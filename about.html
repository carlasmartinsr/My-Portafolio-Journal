          After nearly 10 years in the tourism industry, my professional journey
          has been a path filled with unexpected twists and significant changes.
          My experience as a Systems Engineer in Venezuela barely extended to
          six months before life pushed me in a new direction. That direction
          led me to Spain, where I discovered my true passion in the tourism
          industry. Interacting directly with tourists, selling shows, and
          managing operations for groups kept me active and in constant contact
          with people, something I deeply valued.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          However, the pandemic drastically transformed my trajectory. I found
          myself unemployed and confined, which pushed me to explore new
          horizons. I delved into the world of programming and design, taking
          online courses on various platforms. It was at Scrimba where I found
          clarity and a defined purpose, and it's also budget-friendly.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Despite having started working in an office, I continue to question
          myself: do I want to remain confined, either in an office or at home,
          working in technology or another field, or do I prefer to be in direct
          contact with people, enjoying most of my time outdoors instead of
          being within four walls? In the tourism industry, I found a simpler
          way to balance my personal life with work, something I deeply miss.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Despite the challenges, I find satisfaction in learning and
          self-discovery. As I explored the realms of programming and design, I
          also discovered more about myself. I have found new activities, such
          as drawing, rediscovered pleasures as simple as running in a park or
          as magical as being with cats. My journey is ongoing, and although the
          return to the tourism industry is uncertain, I will continue learning
          and exploring. The pandemic has taught me the importance of adapting
          and growing, reminding me of how unpredictable life can be in the
          blink of an eye.
