          After nearly 10 years in the tourism industry, my professional journey
          has been a path filled with unexpected twists and significant changes.
          Upon moving to Spain, my job search led me tourism industry, where I
          took on various roles, including promoter, assisting tourists, and
          working in bookings. What I enjoyed most was interacting with people,
          which kept me dynamic and engaged.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          However, the pandemic drastically transformed my trajectory. I found
          myself unemployed and confined, which pushed me to explore new
          horizons. I delved into the world of programming and design, taking
          online courses on various platforms. It was at Scrimba where I found
          clarity and a defined purpose, and it's also budget-friendly.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Despite having finished my office job, I still question whether I
          prefer to work in environments that involve direct interaction with
          people and a more active role, or whether I am content with the more
          stationary nature of office work.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          In Turkey, alongside my work, I took the initiative to help the street
          cats in my neighborhood. I fed them and took them to the vet whenever
          possible, collaborating with other local cat enthusiasts. This effort
          was driven by our own initiative, without being affiliated with any
          organization.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Now that Iâ€™m in a new country, everything is still uncertain, and I
          remain adaptable and open to new opportunities. The pandemic taught me
          the importance of adaptability and personal growth, reminding me how
          quickly life can change. What comes next is still a question without a
          clear answer.
